## Notes ##

The single inheritance class structure shown in this documentation is simplified from the actual (multiple inheritance) implementation to make it easier to understand. Only users wishing to extend existing htmltemplate classes need be aware of the full class hierarchy; it makes no difference in normal use.

htmltemplate 2.x is the modern Python 3 successor to the old Python 2 HTMLTemplate 1.x module. The codebase has been cleaned up and ported to Python 3, the API redesigned to provide greater flexibility and robustness, and the documentation and sample scripts updated and improved. If you wish to use htmltemplate in Python 2, the third-party [3to2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2) tool can automatically backport it, though any code originally written for HTMLTemplate will require some modifications to make it compatible with htmltemplate.
